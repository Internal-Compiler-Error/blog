# The Sound of Gothenburg
In Flames is definitely an interesting band. For many (including me), this is the greatest example of the melodic death
movement of the 1990s in the Swedish city of Gothenburg. Their first four album, *Lunar Strain*, *The Jester Race*,
*Whoracle* and *Colony* are some of the best the genre has to offer. During that era, In Flames was invincible. They
graduated developed their unique style and their guitarist progressed significantly in the technical department. 

# The First Crack
*Clayman*, their fifth album released in 2000 was the first sign that In Flames wanted more. Just as they were finding
the traditonal death metal becoming boring in the early 1990s, they were finding the melodic death metal scene 
approaching the same path. This is the first album that has more elements than just melodic death metal. *Only for the 
Weak*, the most famous track is a lot more palatable and poppy than say all the tracks on *Colony*. It was a new 
direction for In Flames, they are to become more mainstream.

## Metal and Mainstream
Metal always had a strange relationship with becoming mainstream. In the eyes of metal purists/orthodox, metal is an
expression of rebellion and becoming popular degrades this quality. They especially cannot bands adopting more poppy
element to appeal to the masses. The view, however, is problematic. If the work is well liked, then more people will
naturally want to enjoy it. Regardless of whether it's "watered down" or not, it still takes a lot of work for even the
most "watered down" metal to be popular to those who think hard rock is actually heavy. Metal bands trying to be
popular is nothing to be sad at.[^1] We have egos, and sometimes, we want to exercise it.

> People want to like you. Let them!

# *Reroute to Remain*
*Reroute to Remain* was the first album that In Flames heavily deviated from melodic death metal. The tuning was lower,
the importance of bass is enhanced and drums play a significant role. To many, this is actually a metalcore release. 

As the album name implies, In Flames felt the old melodic death metal scene needs new blood. However, opinion was split.
Some fans liked the new direction and some fans hated it. Unknown to those hated the new direction, more is to come.

# *Come Clarity*
In Flames really improved their album naming after *Clayman*. *Come Clarity* doubled down on the new direction, more heavy
low end and rap style dirty vocal delivery. The split that was present in the *Reroute to Remain* was even more present.
Nevertheless, it is an awesome album. 

# *A Sense of Purpose* 
This was the turning point of the band's history. It was blindingly clear at that point that In Flames isn't the band
from the 1990s anymore. They are more polished, mainstream and eager for more.
