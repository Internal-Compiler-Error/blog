# So, this is it?
People who graduated from high school in 2020 is a unlucky bunch. We managed to miss the prom and the entire 
university first year experience. If there is any conciliation, missing prom probably made no difference to lots of 
computer science kids and most computer science people that I know don't have a particular affection for drinking.[^1]

# Fellow degenerates
Obviously most people are not on campus this year, which means socialization in person basically doesn't happen. 
Luckily, someone posted a discord server link for people in computing at Guelph. I often say that don't place 
programmers together, it never ends well. Ooops, you just got a bunch of programmers in one server. 

Discord is an interesting service, its aesthetic and user experience is clearly catered for those either game or have
some interest in technology.[^2] If you know and use Discord, I don't think there is much help for you to go back to the
"normal" world. Naturally, the server adopted aesthetics, such as offering varies emojis based on pepe the frog. While
the origin of the frog has no connection to the alt-right, they have stolen and transformed its identify as a symbol of 
alt-right. Sadly, lots of people only know the alt-right side. 

The server is filled with people who are interested and passionate in computer science
