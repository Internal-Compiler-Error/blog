      <description>The Sound of Gothenburg In Flames is an interesting band. For many (including me), this is the greatest example of the melodic death movement of the 1990s in the Swedish city of Gothenburg. Their first four albums, Lunar Strain, The Jester Race, Whoracle and Colony are some of the best the genre has to offer. During that era, In Flames was invincible. They gradually developed their unique style and their guitarists progressed significantly in the technical department.</description>
