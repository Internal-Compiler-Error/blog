  October 16, 2022: I&rsquo;ve added my update to my situation and fixed some typos. If you want to see the previous state of the post, please see the commit.
After a year of the Software Engineering (SENG) program at the University of Guelph, I can confidently say that the program offers no value over the Computer Science (CS) program if you have Co-op. SENG is a poor attempt at trying to mimic real-world development by an institution that has no connection in reality.

  Issues of std::rand() std::rand() is an abomination inherited from C. If you want to be correct, the use case of it so limited you might as well use some other library that does the right thing.
The Pigeonhole Principle for natural numbers k and m, if n = km + 1 objects are distributed among m sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least k + 1 objects.

  The Sound of Gothenburg In Flames is an interesting band. For many (including me), this is the greatest example of the melodic death movement of the 1990s in the Swedish city of Gothenburg. Their first four albums, Lunar Strain, The Jester Race, Whoracle and Colony are some of the best the genre has to offer. During that era, In Flames was invincible. They gradually developed their unique style and their guitarists progressed significantly in the technical department.
