      <description>After a year of the Software Engineering (SENG) program at the University of Guelph, I can confidently say that the program offers no value over the Computer Science (CS) program if you have Co-op. SENG is a poor attempt at trying to mimic real-world development by an institution that has no connection in reality.
To copycat Voltaire
 The Software Engineering program is not about software, nor about engineering and barely a sensible program</description>

      <description>Issues of std::rand() std::rand() is an abomination inherited from C. If you want to be correct, the use case of it so limited you might as well use some other library that does the right thing.
The Pigeonhole Principle  for natural numbers k and m, if n = km + 1 objects are distributed among m sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least k + 1 objects.</description>
